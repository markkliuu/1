We managed the progression of the task using Trello. This allowed everyone easily see how much work was completed and what tasks we need to do. This also help with the visualisation of how much we had to do and when we had to do it by to complete the task. We would also have weekly meetings to see how everyone was going and if certain weeks needed it we would add more meetings if we need then to stay on track and keep making progress, along with this we also were constantly messaging each other about problems we had or progress that we made to make sure everyone was up to date and everyone was adding the most value they could. We used Microsoft teams for our meetings as it is easy to share screens and show everyone in the group things and the meeting planning functionality helped us know when we had scheduled our meetings. We managed the sharing of code by allocating pages for everyone to do. This mean that they knew everything in that page making it easier to keep track of what we are up to. Additionally, we had our own branches in git and then we would just update the to the master which was our default branch for the repository, this allowed us all to work on multiple parts but not create to many conflicts or issues with versions changing. Furthermore, we created extra branches and used them as previous save points, even though we could roll back our version in git this allowed us to easily see the previous code for when it was running and so we could make changes and fix problems more easily. \
We used a scrum approach and created a highly jelled team. We all felt as if we could rely on each other and made work together well. Oscar was our product owner and helped us keep on track and led our weekly meetings, when David was the scrum master as he made sure the dev team was working well and was a key resource for any issues, Mark and Aiden were apart of the dev team.\
