# Usability Summary 
Nielsen’s heuristics 10 principles are adopted in application design as a guideline in order to provide a maximum users-centric experience. User understanding, user operation and feedback wise of the design will be discussed. 

## User Understanding 
### Real-World Match 
The application should use users’ language, instead of system and programming language. In GuestBook page, the button was changed from ‘Admin landing page’ to ‘Events’, ‘Admin landing page’ was initially named because that is directly what we wanted in design phase, whereas ‘Events’ sounds more approaching to users. Similarly, ‘User’ has been changed to ‘Profile’ displayed on button, as user’s first instinct would be to check what content is under themselves, which makes ‘Profile’ closely suit user’s thinking.  

### Consistency and Standards
The style of design is kept consistent. Events2Go logo has always been displayed at top left corner of every single page, which illustrates the branding. In addition, all buttons are design to be white text within blue backgrounds so as to make users feel smoothness in transitioning among pages. All navigation bars have been set to at the right and above the main content, as normalised design standards. Thus, users are provided with a sense of “one-product” by consistent style and uniform design. 

### Aesthetics and Minimalism
The style is design to kept simple, meaning there is no too much fancy design that would interrupted usability. Also, the colour use of bright orange, use of grey in main area and the blue form a colour balance within a page. Without the light grey, the mass white area would be felt too palm, but if dark grey is used, the theme of the page looked dull. 

### No irrelevant information 
No extra information or columns are built within the design in order to not distract users form the main functionalities.  

## User Operation 
User Control and Freedom
Once guests are directed to landing page. Events options are displayed straight in front to provide direct access. No multiple layers or columns have been designed, as that would have made them confused to find where the events are located at and lead to unsatisfying experience.

### Recognition not Recall 
Schedule function has been designed after guest clicked interested on a specific event, which enables them to choose a future time to automatically be reminded in case guests have forgotten. After guest clicked interested, the event will display on their landing page once logged in so they do not waste time memorising registered events. 

### Flexibility and Efficiency 
The whole design is simple for users to navigate their operation in the most efficient manner. The application will satisfy the functionalities without multiple layers have been design. 

## Feedback 
### Error Prevention 
In considering guest may forget their access codes and admin may forgot username/password, ‘Help’ button is designed to provide direct access to service centre where staff will help to reset credentials. 

### Visibility of System Status 
No massive download tasks are required and no massive information is needed to load in one page according to application requirements. Therefore, progress bar and likewise tools will not be needed at the current stage. 

### Help and Documentation 
Relevant sources (Website) is provided in consideration to display application features and to help guide new users. Most importantly, Copyright, Privacy and other legal issues have been clarified in Help page to meet the compliance.
