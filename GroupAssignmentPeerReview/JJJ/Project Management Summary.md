# **Project Management Summary** 

In order to ensure that our team efficiently allocated and completed all tasks on time; we engaged with several project management tools and methadologies.

These processes have assisted us in being able to identify, allocate and complete tasks; whilst keeping everyone in the group accountable and aware of 

each individuals progress. Throughout the assignment, our team engaged with Scrum - an agile methadology - dividing the key assignment processes into 4 main iterative stages.

Scrum was choosen, as we felt that in order to coherently develop this application; it was necessary to continuously revise and adapt the application to suit the assesment requirements.


### **Stage One - Intialising and setting up ** 
This was the intial stage of our assignment, where our group spent time understanding the assignment specifications and requirements. Along with that, 

there was also the technical aspect of setting-up the git-hub repositries and our forms of communication and documentation. As this assignment is largely technical;

This intial stage lasted several weeks - as we strived to understand how we could incorporate concepts learnt in class into the assignment. Our comunication chanels 

was predominatley through: 

*Messenger (A Facebook messaging app); 

*github

*Google docs 

*Trello 

Messenger was used to conduct our weekly meetings; which gradualy tranisitioned into daily calls where we had our sprint sessions. Overall, Messenger was utilised as more of a facilitating tool

where our group memebers updated each other and asked general queries. 

Our group used an combination of Google docs and Trello as a shared platform where we could assign tasks and upload the material. Trello was set-up to track progress of members and ensure 

that everyone was on track to completing their assigned roles. 


### **Stage two - Scope and Design** 

Stage two consisted of our team breaking down the requirements of the assignment and collaborating in order to design the User Interface. In order to do so, our group utilised 

a platform called **Balsamiq** which is a collaborative online platform used to design wireframes. It is important to emphasis that as we followed the Scrum methadology, Stage two 

was largely a iterative processs. This meant that our team consistently revisited our wireframe designs on Balsamiq in order to update the required functionalities (which we learnt as 

we progressed through the course). 


### ** Stage three - Individual Roles within the Assignment** 

Stage three was the stage where our group largely branched off into our individual roles and responsibilities. This meant that individuals began working 

on seperate parts of the assignment and began uploading these to share with our group. The primary platform used for this stage was **github**. Stemming from the 

Master Branch, our group created several individual branches to upload documents and our source code. As we had several individuals working on the source code, 

this meant that each individual was assigned to specific files within the code (e.g. Database, app, fxml) and were required to make pull requests, add, commit and push changes 

from their gitHub desktop app onto the cloud. Stage three was an iterative process, where our team was required to continously update and modify the source code in order to ensure 

it aligned with everyones individual parts and also met the assignment requirements. 


### Stage four **Compiling the work and Reviewing** 

This stage ecompassed our team compiling the code and assessing which areas were successful and which areas needed review. This took multiple runs and edits, as individuals 

needed to align their individual codes so that it was consistent with those which other group memebers prepared. This stage was completed on github, where individuals attempted to 

compare their branches and download each files to integrate it into one singular branch, and eventually the master branch. Feedback and help was given to individuals who were stuck on

certain parts or if individuals wanted to refine certain elements of the assignment. 

### **Contingency Planning** 

Throughout the assignment, our group encountered several curve balls which required us to plan an alternate course of work. Due to the Covid-19 health crisis, 

our group could no longer meet up in person to discuss and conduct Sprints. Therefore, this required us to shift our mode of communication fully online and ensure that 

individuals will respond and follow up. Furthermore, as we no longer had face- to face interactions; it required our group to consistently communicate to each other and regularly update 

on our online platforms to ensure progress. In the case where members were unable to communicate or complete their work in time, other members took the initative to look for alternative ways 

of completion. 


### **Conclusion**

In conculsion, incorporating project management elements brough clarity and structure towards our group assignment. Importantly, it allowed our group to communicate and facilitate work between each 
other. Overall, this allowed us to grasp the key concepts taught in infs2605 and apply it within our project through a collaborative environment.
