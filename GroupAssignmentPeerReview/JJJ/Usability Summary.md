## **Usability Summary** 

 While designing the user interface for Captivate Events, our team focused on integrating the design principles defined by Neilson (1994).
 
 This was imperative to ensure that users are able to navigate through our interface in a easy and engaging manner. 
 
 Below, we will outline the key Usability Heuristics which have been utilised and how they have improved the functionality of the Captivate Events application. 
 
 ###**Visibility of system status** 
 
 As our system targets two different users - which are **Admin** and **Guest** our team implemented the concept of _Visbility of system status_ 
 
 So that users are aware of their current status on the system. This was achieved through creating separate logins for both user groups and subsequently
 
 having this user status displayed on top left-hand corner.  
 
 
 ### **Match with real world** 
 
 We utlised the principle of _Match with real world_ to ensure that users understand what each functionality within our application is.
 
 This was achieved through adding and aligning icons next to the written description of the functionality (e.g. A information icon for the functionality of About).
 
 By mirroring the real life images through icons -> we believe that users will find it easier to identify and understand what each function within the application is. 
 
 
### **Consistency and Standards** 

Consistency and standards are implemented to ensure that there is cohesion between our application functionalities. The consistency 

subsequently allows users to gain a sense of familiarity between the application - allowing them to feel more comfortable navigating through

it. Our team engaged with this principle through desiging a consistent layout throughout each page in our application. This included the same 

positioning of the dashboard and menu bars (in the left) along with a centre focus for each functionality table. Furthermore, we used the same text font

and text size for titles and functionalities throughout each page. 


### **Asethetic and minimalistic design** 

Following on from a consistent layout for each page; our team also focused on ensuring that the application's design was visually pleasing. 

This wa achieved through following Neilson's guide on Asethetic and minimalistics desgin (1994) which outlines that the page should only contain

relevant information and follow a consistent colour scheme. Therefore, within our design we ensured that the colour scheme was limited to 4 complimenting

colours such as 

*white for the background 
* Black text 
*Black icons 
*yellow and orange for the logo 
*Grey for the tables 

Furthermore, the pages only consisted of necessary functions as we strived to adhere to minimalism. Thus this created a clear and easy to read 

website; effectively allowing for users to feel a sense of comfort and ease as they are not overwhelmed by information or instructions. This is 

particulary important for our site, as it requires external users (Guests) who will need to be able to use the functionalities in order to 

gain information on their events. 


### **Help users recognise, diagnose and recover from errrors** 

In order to ensure that users are engaging with application properly, our team strived to _Help users recognise, diagnosw and recover from errors_. 

This is achieved through engaging with a range of JavaFx and coding principles which set parameters to ensure that users are inputing  the correct 

data needed for right action. When this is not the case; weve designed the system to immediately identify and send a statement to users to identify their

mistakes and take the necessary course of action. A key example of such is our login page; which prompts individuals to enter their username and password if they 

existing users. If the information they entered is incorrect; the code will prevent individuals from logging with a text appearing stating that _Login Failed_; 

_Incorrect password or username_. Effectively this diagnoes and instructs users to recover from the errors. Overall, this is a key principle which is needed 

to ensure that users engage with all functionalities properly, and are aware if this is not the case. 


### In conclusion; Neilsons Heuristic Principles (1994) were imperative in guiding us on creating a platform which is able to engage and facilitate its core

processes in a easy and efficient way. By following these principles, Captivate Events has ensured that our design is usable by all users - Admins and Guests alike;


allowing them to easily engage with our core business processes.
