INFS2605 Group Assignment Project Form

-   It is your teamâ€™s responsibility to ensure that your source code deliverable
    ships with a runnable JAR file. **Submissions that do not run (or indeed, do
    not compile) could result in a ZERO mark for the source code deliverable of
    the assignment.**

-   Academic honesty is expected. An incomplete or deceptive project form (i.e.,
    a form that very obviously claims more completed than actually completed)
    could result in 10% being deducted from your final mark for the assignment.
